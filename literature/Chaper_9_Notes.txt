General Notes from the Literature:
Chapter 9:  Brain-Computer Interfaces for patients with disorders of consciousness

Disorders of consciousness (DoC):
- vegetative state (VS, or unresponsive wakefulness syndrome UWS)
- minimally conscious state (MCS)
  - MCS- : Wakefulness with nonreflexive behaviour
  - MCS+ : MCS- with additional command following
- coma: acute condition in which the person lacks wakefulness and awareness

Factors of reduced responsiveness:
- fluctuating arousal
- fatigue
- lack of interest
- concurrent cognitive and sensory limitations from brain injury
- motor impairments

Rate of misdiagnosing of patients: about 43%


Uses of BCI Systems for DoC patients:
- detection of cognitive assessment of awareness
- communication
- environmental control

Ways to determine level of consciousness:
- asking a patient to engage in mental imagery during a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan
- using electroencephalographic (EEG) responses to imagined movement (P3b signals)

Problems/Challenges with patients using BCI-Systems:
- lack of oculomotor control
- sensory and cognitive abilities are potentially compromised by acquired brain injuries and concurrent medical complications
- MCS patients are susceptible to aphasia
- severe brain injury patients even with sophisticated abilities consistent with EMCS, can have difficultly answering yes/no questions
- suffering from fatigue and fluctuating arousal
- breach rhythm renders EEG useless in patients with skull breach
- Contamination of the EEG by motion or sweating artifacts
- patients often produce ERPs with reduced amplitude due to cortical atrophy (P300 signal is not as clear)

Electroencephalography
""""""""""""""""""""""
Pros:
- very high temporal resolution
- non-invasive
- signals acquired with minimal health risks
- most practical for regular use
Cons:
- cannot be used in patients with skull breach
- susceptible to non-neuronal electrical signals (noise)
- Best results with training

Event related potentials (ERP):
EEG signals are frequently evaluated after being time-locked to a stimulus or response of interest and averaged over repeated presentations.
This averaged, time-locked EEG signal is known as an event-related potential.

Sensorimotor rhythms:
- oscillations in magnetic or electric fields recorded over sensorimotor cortex in the mu (8–12 Hz), beta (18–30 Hz), and gamma (30–200 Hz) frequency bands
- event-related desynchronization (ERD)
- event-related synchronization (ERS)
- detection of movement and movement planning
- ERD magnitude is proportional to positive blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) responses

P300 Event-Related Potentials (P3, P3a, P3b):
- a positive-going ERP that peaks about 300 ms after a rare stimulus
- elicited by an infrequent, oddball stimulus within a series of events from two classes
-reflects bottom-up, preconscious processing (P3a)
- reflects top-down, conscious information processing (P3b)
- The P3b differs from the P3a in that it is usually largest over parietal sites and tends to occur at a longer interval from the eliciting stimulus than the P3a
- P3b paradigms are often employed for awareness detection applications.

Steady State Evoled Potentials:
- a repetitive series of voltage deflections phase-locked to a sensory event
- consists of a fundamental frequency corresponding to the frequency of the stimulus and its harmonics
- recent improvements by classifying three harmonic peaks, including higher harmonics and subharmonics of the stimulation frequency, rather than only one or two peaks

Slow Cortical Potentials:
- time-locked and phase-locked ERPs elicited by sensorimotor events
- negative deflections that arise in a latency range from 0.5 s or more preceding an actual or imagined movement
- slow signal and patients need extensive training to regulate their SCPs


Single- or Multiunit Neuronal Activity
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
Pros:
- Better Control of the BCI System
- lower attentional and learning demands during BCI operation (less training)
Cons:
- invasive
- in most applications, one must tether the electrode to the skull, which results in movement of the electrode due to cardiac or respiratory pulsations
- immune response of the brain tissue to the implant
- degradation of the implant while it is exposed to the warm, salty environment of the human brain
- regular implant-based BCI use generally requires a technician for device calibration

- Mainly used for multidimensional control of systems (such as a cursor or robotic arm)


BOLD Response:
"""""""""""""
- refers to changes in hemoglobin (Hb) that occur with brain activity
- The two techniques to measure the BOLD response most relevant to BCI applications are fMRI and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS)

Pros:
- informative for BCI research and development
- fMRI approaches are useful to provide anatomically specific feedback to users
- fNIRS is safe, noninvasive, portable, and not as sensitive to stray electrical signals as EEG
Cons:
- impractical because blood flow changes are slow
- fMRI technology is expensive to obtain, operate, and maintain, and these approaches are impractical for use in daily life
